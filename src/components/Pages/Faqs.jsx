                <h2>How Many Steps Should I Have in My Skincare Routine?</h2>
                <p>When people hear about 10 step skincare routines there‚Äôs always that slight fear. Then you question your routine like wait‚Ä¶ Am I supposed to have that many steps too? Do I really need to buy that many products? Doesn‚Äôt that take too much time? Yeah, we totally understand how the concept of skincare can seem daunting to some people. But you know what?

                     <br></br>
                     <p>Everyone‚Äôs skin has its own story so decide based on what your skin likes. That may take some trial and error 
                        but it‚Äôs necessary to find your perfect products! </p>

                         with 3-4 steps then by all means! Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing! The best thing you can
                          do for your skin is to listen to it and ensure that you‚Äôre not doing too much or too little.</p>

                <h2>Beginner's Guide to Exfoliants</h2>
                <h3>What is an Exfoliator?</h3>
                <p>When you don‚Äôt exfoliate your skin, dead skin cells sit on the outer layer of your face and clogs your pores, causing your skin to break out or produce blackheads. An exfoliator will help remove dead skin cells that sit on the surface of your face, allowing your skin to stay clean and perform a better job at renewing itself. Any skin problems (blemishes, dry patches, hyperpigmentation, dullness, etc.) will also heal faster and better! Exfoliating also helps your skin thoroughly absorb your other skincare products because that layer of dead skin is no longer there, allowing your serums, essence, and other treatment products 
                    to really sink into your skin and perform correctly!</p>
                    <br></br>
                <p>One thing we have to stress is to exfoliate gently! In general, you should always be gentle with your skin, but especially when it comes to exfoliating. Scrubbing too hard against your skin can damage your skin barrier and create more problems such as dry skin, irritation, and breakouts. All your skin needs is a bit of gentle friction to help loosen up the dead skin cells, 
                    so nothing too abrasive. üòå</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>What Kinds are there?</h3>
                <p>There are two types of exfoliators: </p>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>Physical Exfoliators</b></p><p>These are different types of scrubs that gently 
                    rub the surface of your skin to remove dead skin cells. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>scrubs</li>
                    <li> Gels</li>
                    <li>Sugar/salt</li>
                    <li>Exfoliating Tools</li>
                </ul>
                <br></br>
                <p><b>Chemical Exfoliators</b></p><p>These are ingredients in skincare products 
                    that aid in cell turnover by helping pick up the dead skin cells on your face. These include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>AHA</li>
                    <li> PHA</li>
                    <li>BHA</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> Which one is best for your skin type?</h3>
                <p>There is no set exfoliator for certain skin types. All skin types can work with both forms of exfoliation. The best way to see if it works for you is to try it out! Experiment with different types to see which one works best for your skin. Generally, you want to exfoliate 2-3 times a week and adjust it depending on your skin. Also, it‚Äôs best not to exfoliate on a shaving or waxing day, your skin is already sensitive and exfoliating it will sting and irritate your skin üò£ 
                This also goes if you have any open cuts or unhealed blemishes.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>So try out an exfoliator and get ready to see the difference in your complexion and as well as the
                     overall health of your skin!</p>
                     <br></br>

            <div id="patch-test">
                <h2>How to Patch Test a Product</h2>
                <p>Here is a pretty good reason why you might want to slow your roll there. üõë  üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Skincare is made to help many people of many different skin types and there could always be that off chance that a certain product just doesn‚Äôt work well with your skin. And before you know it, your face is itchy and red. Yikes. This is a scenario no one wants to go through. So, testing a product is especially important if you have sensitive or sensitized/reactive skin. To help you all out, here are our tips for patch testing a product- something you should always do when you get a new product, 
                    no matter what skin type you have! üëçüèª</p>
                    <h3>You'll want to patch test for 3 different things</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Allergic Reactions</li>
                        <li>Comedogenicity</li>
                        <li>Irritations</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>Now, if you do have an allergic reaction while testing out a product, wash the area you tested with water and a gentle/mild cleanser. After, you‚Äôll want to follow up with your basic moisturizer. Return the product if you can or try handing it over to a friend who might 
                        have better luck with it!</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <p>You can also try applying Milk of Magnesia or a cold plain yogurt to the affected area. Leave it on for 15 minutes, rinse, 
                            and repeat every few hours if needed.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Your Skin</h2>
                <p>Here are our top 3 tips to help you out!!</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Pay attention to what you are putting on your face</h3>
                <p>Whatever is going on in your body will reflect on the outside. So, if you‚Äôre eating unhealthy, chances are it will show up on your skin in various ways as well. Maybe through excess oils, blemishes, redness, etc. The first step to helping your skin is to take care of your body and feed it well! This is super important 
                    for your skin and overall health!</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Pay attention to your environment</h3>
                <p>The skin takes on quite a lot if you really think about it. It‚Äôs your body‚Äôs protection/ security guard. Your skin has contact with the world around you. So, think about how your environment might be playing a role. Do you live in an area with a lot of pollution? Grab that detox mask! Maybe you live in a dry area. If that‚Äôs the case, hydrating and moisturizing masks are the way to go! Don‚Äôt overlook the role the environment 
                    can have on your skin!</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Know what ingredients your skin likes</h3>
                <p>This is going to be a little more difficult because a lot of the time, you don‚Äôt know what skincare ingredients you‚Äôre allergic to unless your skin actually has contact with that specific ingredient. It's definitely tricky, but our tip for this is to always, always, ALWAYS patch test new products 
                when you incorporate them into your routine</p>
                <br></br>

            <div id="dark-spots">
                <h2>Fading Dark Spots</h2>
                <p>One of the most common skincare questions we hear is, "how do I fade dark spots?!" It goes to show that having hyperpigmentation is something everyone deals with! But the road to a clear and even tone takes patience and time. Not to fret though! We've got you covered. Here's what you need to do to help even out your skin tone and fade those dark spots, all while making sure they 
                don't get any more pigmentated!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Exfoliate your skin</b></li>
                    <p>Exfoliating your skin can help speed up your skin‚Äôs healing process because it removes the dead skin cells sitting at the top layer of your skin. Think about it, if you have dead skin staying on your skin, then how can your products sink into your skin correctly? Just imagine the build-up! Exfoliating is necessary for your skin's regeneration and healing process! Just make sure you're not over-exfoliating! 
                        Start off with 2x a week and adjust from there.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Use sunscreen</b></li>
                    <p>Sunscreen is super important because it protects your skin from harmful UV rays that can cause dark spots and skin cancer. It also prevents any further damage that can be done to the skin. And when it comes to dark spots you may already have, well yeah, sunscreen can help prevent those spots from getting darker, 
                    making the fading process much easier!</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Vitamin C</b></li>
                    <p>This ingredient helps brighten the skin and fade dark spots. It‚Äôs definitely a go-to skincare ingredient for many skin types! Find Vitamin C in your serums, moisturizers, sheet masks, etc! This ingredient can be strong depending on your skin type so always patch test and listen to what your skin is telling you. But no doubt! This skincare ingredient is a must-have for many! We love pairing these two together: FaceTory Be Bright Be You Mask & FaceTory Artemisia Toner.
                    ÔªøThey're great matches!</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Retinol</b></li>
                    <p>Retinol (Vitamin A) does many things for the skin! And it's just as great for fading dark spots. This ingredient is known to have amazing regenerating properties. Young and sensitive skin types may have to be extra careful with this ingredient as it may be too strong so always patch test and look at the concentration of ingredients. This ingredient may be included in a product prescribed by your dermatologist or you can find it in smaller concentrations
                    in different products you can buy in-store! </p>
                    <br></br>
                </ul>

            <div id="blackheads">
                <h2>Getting Rid of Blackheads</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Always cleanse and reapply sunscreen</b></li>
                    <p> Cleansing your skin morning and night will help remove any dirt, dust, and gunk that was sitting on your face; preventing clogged pores. Sunscreen is suuuuuper important in the morning and throughout the day to help protect your skin from sun damage. It will also help minimize any dark spots 
                    that you may have!</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Use BHA</b></li>
                    <p>BHA, also known as Beta Hydroxy Acids, is an ingredient that helps unclog pores and exfoliates the skin. This step is important for removing dead skin cells from the surface of your skin. BHA does a great job doing this 
                    and helping minimize blemishes</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Oil cleansing</b></li>
                    <p>This is a trick we like doing when our pores 
                    feel extra clogged!</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <li><b>Keep your skin hydrated</b></li>
                    <p>This is one of the most important tips. Keeping your skin hydrated won't only aid in minimize blackheads but it will help with pretty much most of your skincare troubles (i.e. redness, blemishes, sensitivity, dark spots, excess oil production, dryness, aging, 
                        the list just goes on!)</p>
